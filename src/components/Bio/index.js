          My name is Robert Prusinowski. I have worked in IT for over 29 years.
          The start to my carrer was with the phone company doing basic
          residential line installs, moving into business phone systems until I
          moved into my own business as a Network and telephony VAR.

          Finding I was more of an IT person rather than a business manager my
          career turned towads enterprise work and builing middleware so that
          the phone systems and IVRs could interact with business systems. Now
          with the changes in the busioness landscape I am taking a class to
          move towards becoming a full stack developer.
